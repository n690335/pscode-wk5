// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

set int a
set int b

a+b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

set int a

a divided by 2, if modulus is greater than 0 = odd, otherwise even


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

set int a
set int b
set int c
set int d
set int e

set int avg average ( Sum(a:e) )
set int minrange min range a:e
set int maxrange max range a:e

display avg
display minrange maxrange



a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
